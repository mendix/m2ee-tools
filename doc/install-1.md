# Installing the Mendix software

## ** M2EE-tools only support Debian 10 (buster) and Mendix Runtime versions 7-9. Further version support will not be added anymore. **

To be able to run Mendix applications, the following pieces of software need to
be installed:

 * Mendix Deployment tools (m2ee-tools), to manage deployments and application
   processes. Also, a few Python library dependencies.
 * curl, to be able to conveniently download the Mendix Runtime server
   distribution files.
 * A suitable Java Runtime Environment.

The current Python library dependencies are:
 * PyYAML
 * requests

This page first of all describes installation instructions for Debian GNU/Linux
in case a system wide installation is done using provided software packages.
The section after that provides hints about setting all of this up on a
different GNU/Linux distribution or even possibly other unix-like systems.

## Deployment Tools for Debian

The deployment tools, written in python are available in a public apt repository. When e.g. using Debian Buster this repository can be added to your apt sources as follows:

    deb http://packages.mendix.com/platform/debian/ buster main contrib non-free

### GPG keyring

In order to trust this repository, you have to import the GPG keys used by Mendix to sign the Release file.

Step 1: Install the current public key manually, using https to download it:

    # wget -q -O - https://packages.mendix.com/mendix-debian-archive-key.asc | apt-key add -
    OK

Step 2: Fetch the package lists. This should succeed without any GPG verification error now.

    # apt-get update
    [...]
    Get:5 http://packages.mendix.com/platform/debian buster InRelease [10.9 kB]
    [...]

Step 3: Install the `debian-mendix-archive-keyring` package from the Mendix repository. Installing this package makes sure that you will automatically receive new public keys when Mendix does a key-rollover to a new key.

    # apt-get install debian-mendix-archive-keyring

### Install!

Now you can install m2ee-tools:

    # apt-get install m2ee-tools
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree
    Reading state information... Done
    The following additional packages will be installed:
      python-httplib2 python-m2ee python-yaml
    The following NEW packages will be installed:
      m2ee-tools python-httplib2 python-m2ee python-yaml
    0 upgraded, 5 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
    Need to get 691 kB of archives.
    After this operation, 1,743 kB of additional disk space will be used.
    Do you want to continue? [Y/n]
    [...]

## Doing a manual m2ee-tools install

It's also perfectly fine to run the m2ee-tools from a git clone, or from a
download of one of the tagged releases on github. In this case you have to make
sure the Python library dependencies are also installed. How to do this, using
either provided packages available from the currently used operating system,
or, using pip, is left as choice to the experienced system administrator.

## Oracle Java JRE or OpenJDK JRE

In order to run the Mendix server, you also need an OpenJDK or Oracle Java JRE
runtime environment. Which Java JRE to use depends on the version of the Mendix
Business Modeler you're using to create the application that needs to run on
your new server.

 * Mendix 6 and 7 need JRE 8
 * From Mendix 8 on, a recent OpenJDK version should be used.

For Debian, the OpenJDK JRE that is packaged in Debian can be used. This is for
example the openjdk-11-jre-headless package.

If you have multiple JRE packages installed, make sure you have the preferred
one by default in your path. Use update-java-alternatives to choose which java
binary will be the default on your search path. Alternatively, use the
`javabin` option in the m2ee configuration file to specify the exact location
of the java executable. More explanation about the configuration file is
available in the next documentation pages.
