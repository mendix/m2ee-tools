    introduces a new exception type: M2EERuntimeNotFullyRunning

    that happens when handling a request. This introduces a new exception type:
    M2EEAdminTimeout

m2ee-tools 7.0, 13 Feb 2017
  * Major rewrite of internal error handling. Boolean return codes have been
    replaced with proper exception handling.
  * Cleanup of nagios plugin messages, to make them more
    understandable
  * The built-in nagios plugin now checks license expiry. It's
    currently hard coded to 30 days for warning and 7 days for critical.
  * Drop Mendix 2.5 compatibility. (now supports at least 3.0)
  * Drop python 2.5 compatibility (2.7 recommended)
  * The download runtime command now uses curl and handles incomplete
    downloads more nicely.
  * A new interactive command is added, cleanup_runtimes, which
    removes unused downloaded Mendix Runtime versions.
  * During statistics gathering in the munin plugin, the timeout when
    contacting the Runtime Admin API has been lowered, so that a non-responding
    application will not cause skipping other plugins that still have to be run
    on the host.
